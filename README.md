### How to run test scripts
In order to run the test scripts you will need to clone this repo in your homework repo:
```
$ cd <your homework repo directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/datasys-classrooms/cs553-fall2022-hw5-testing.git
```

You can then run all the checks and tests by calling:
```
$ bash cs553-fall2022-hw5-testing/check-submission.sh all
$ bash cs553-fall2022-hw5-testing/test-submission.sh all
```

Or you can run an individual check or test by calling:
```
$ bash <path to cs553-fall2022-hw5-testing>/check-submission.sh <check number>
$ bash <path to cs553-fall2022-hw5-testing>/test-submission.sh <test number>
